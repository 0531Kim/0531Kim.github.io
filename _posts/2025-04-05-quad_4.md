## 📚 1. Introduction

There are approximately 6,800 courses at the University of Auckland. These courses are organized into around 250 studies, which are further grouped into 9 faculties (including General Education).

## 🛠️ 2. Database Design Choices

When designing the database, I considered a few options. One was to create three separate tables — Faculty, Study, and Course — and perform joins when querying, for example, the list of studies under a specific faculty. The other option was to consolidate all information into a single table with 6,800 rows.

I chose to create a single, denormalized table for the following reasons:

1. Courses rarely change, and the system would experience very few write or delete operations. In other words, the table can be treated as a static dataset with primarily read operations, making a single table sufficient.
2. 6,800 rows is relatively small and does not warrant normalization purely for size reasons. Querying such a table typically takes around `150ms`, which is fast enough that it would not negatively impact user experience (UX).

Therefore, considering both the low update frequency and the acceptable query performance, I determined that a simple, denormalized design would be the most efficient and practical choice for this case.

## 🎯 3. UX Challenges and Improvements

Initially, I designed three separate pages: a `Faculty page`, a `Study page`, and a `Course page`. However, navigating to course reviews required too many steps: **Faculty page → click → Study page → click → Course page → click → finally see the reviews**.

To improve the user experience (UX), I replaced the Faculty page with a `faculty navigation bar` that allowed users to jump directly to their desired faculty. This reduced user's click and made navigation much more intuitive.

## 🐢 4. Performance Bottleneck: Initial Observations

However, I noticed another issue: **loading studies and courses felt slow**. It wasn’t that it took longer than a second to load, but it still wasn’t as smooth and immediate as I wanted.

Upon reviewing my code, I initially suspected that **alphabetical sorting** might be a bottleneck. But after analyzing the complexity, I realized that sorting a maximum of 80 courses would only involve approximately **O(n log n)** = `504 comparisons` — a trivial amount of work for a modern CPU, likely completing within just a few milliseconds.

After further research, I discovered `Redis`.

## 🚀 5. Implementing Redis for Caching

`Redis` is an **`in-memory`, `NoSQL` key-value store**, which was exactly what I needed.

Being ` NoSQL`-based means Redis stores data in flexible key-value structures, making it **highly accessible** and **intuitive** for my use case. Furthermore, its `schema-less` nature perfectly matches the structure of courses and studies, which do not require rigid relational models.

From a performance perspective, Redis is optimized for speed: **all data is kept directly in `RAM` rather than on disk**. This allows data retrieval times to skyrocket — **accessing `RAM` is thousands of times faster than disk `I/O`**. Redis can easily handle **hundreds of thousands of requests per second**, making it an ideal solution for reducing latency and delivering a much smoother user experience.

## 🎉 6. Conclusion

I implemented caching for studies and courses using `Redis`, which significantly improved data retrieval speed compared to direct database queries. As a result, users experienced minimal loading times when navigating the frontend, and **overall, the application’s responsiveness and user experience were greatly enhanced.** Although there is still a slight delay, it has been reduced considerably. Beyond the performance improvements, I am also glad that I discovered `Redis` and its many powerful features through this process.

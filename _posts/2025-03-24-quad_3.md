## 🚨 Major update

I made a significant change to my original plan. Initially, I intended to use only `JWT` (`Bearer Token`)–based authentication for all users. However, I decided to integrate `Google OAuth` authentication to **allow users to sign in without storing their credentials on the `Quad` server**.

This decision was made with user trust in mind. I realized that some students might be hesitant to register due to concerns about the security of the `Quad` server. By using `OAuth`, **users can authenticate via `Google`, ensuring that their credentials are never directly handled or stored by our backend**.

I did not implement a “Sign Up with Google” button on the registration page. Instead, I separated the flow into two distinct endpoints:

1. **First-time Google OAuth users**: After successfully authenticating via `Google`, users are redirected to a page where they must set a unique username to complete their account setup.
2. **Returning Google OAuth users**: If the user has previously signed up using `Google OAuth`, they are redirected directly to the main page, and a `cookie` containing the `JWT` is set on the client side for session management.

## 🚏 Api Endpoints for Sign-up and Sign-in

To implement complete authentication logic (including OAuth support and email verification), I have created the following **server-side API endpoints**:

1. Post /api/v1/auth/sign-in

2. Post /api/v1/auth/sign-up

3. Post /api/v1/auth/email-verification

   ​	: Sends a verification code to the provided email address.

4. Post /api/v1/auth/confirm-email-verification

   ​	: Validates the verification code submitted by the user.

5. Post /api/v1/auth/username-check

   ​	: Checks whether the desired username is already in use.

6. Patch /api/v1/auth/change-username

   ​	: Updates a user’s username. This is only used for users who sign up via OAuth, as they are initially assigned a default username. This endpoint allows them to set a custom, unique username.

## 🎰 Email verification code

I recently purchased the domain **quadnz.com** to set up a custom enterprise `Google email` for my project. As part of the user sign-up process, I needed an email address to send verification codes. I decided to use the standard naming convention and created:

> **no-reply@quadnz.com**

## 🏠 Sign-up and Sign-in pages

`Sign-up` and `Sign-in` is implemented with 4 pages.

As users enter `input` or `verification codes`, buttons **gradually light up** to guide their actions. Blue text indicates success, while red text is used for error messages.

When a user signs in with `Google (OAuth)` for the first time, they are redirected to a page where they need to set their username. **Technically, they already have a default username assigned during `sign-up`, so this step is actually about changing the default username to a custom one.**

## **Conclusion**

This time I worked hard to implement **Google OAuth**, and honestly—it was a lot of fun. Seeing my site evolve and finally start to feel like a “proper website” was incredibly satisfying.

Moreover, implementing `sign-up` and `sign-in` also gave me a chance to think more deeply about `user experience (UX)`. I put a lot of effort into making the `sign-up` flow feel smooth and intuitive. I didn’t want users to get bored or confused and leave halfway through the process. That’s why I designed the buttons to gradually light up as users interact with the form. 

Next up: I’ll be working on the main page. There’s a lot more to do there. I’m planning to build a `header`, a `sidebar`, a `trending reviews` , `recent reviews`, and possibly even a `review chart` to visualize some data.

## **Three Ways to Implement Authentication** 

Before implementing user sign-in and sign-up, we need to decide on an authentication method. Generally, there are three common authentication approaches:
1. **Basic authentication**: This method involves sending the userâ€™s credentials (user ID and password) encoded in `Base64` with every request. While it is simple to implement, several critical issues make it unsuitable:

   1. Insecure: Basic authentication transmits credentials in an encoded format, **not encrypted.** Encoding is reversible, meaning **attackers can easily decode and retrieve user credentials**.
   2. Lack of session management: Since there is no session or token-based authentication, **users must send their credentials with every request.** This results in a poor user experienceðŸ˜¡, as users have to repeatedly enter their credentials for every interaction, such as liking or commenting. 

2. **OAuth Authentication**: Many of you have likely signed up for a website using third-party providers such as Google or GitHub. This process is implemented using `OAuth authentication`. **`OAuth` allows users to sign in using external identity providers (e.g., Google, GitHub) without directly handling their credentials.**

   However, I have decided not to use `OAuth` for `Quad` because I will not be integrating third-party authentication services. Although `OAuth` can also support internal authentication systems, implementing it requires significantly more time and effort compared to the next authentication method I will introduce.

3. Bearer Token: When a client signs in, the server generates and transmits a `Bearer Token` to the client. This token remains valid until its expiration time set within the token.

   Once the client receives the `Bearer Token`, it can use it for authentication by attaching it to the `HTTP request header` when accessing protected resources. This is a example of an `HTTP request header` with a `Bearer Token`:

   ```bash
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```

   I will implement `Bearer Token` authentication using `JWT` (JSON Web Token), which provides secure and stateless authentication. It ensures security through encryption with specific algorithms, and its stateless nature eliminates the need for servers to store session data. This means the server doesnâ€™t need to query the database for each request, resulting in faster and more efficient authentication.

## JWT...? Who are you?

1. ### How is a JWT token structured?

   `Jwt` is consist of three parts, separated by dots(.):

   ```bash
   <Header>.<Payload>.<Signature>
   ```

   ```bash
   eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyQGV4YW1wbGUuY29tIiwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiZXhwIjoxNzEwOTUwNDAwfQ.H0VlMa2UNxIl_6Im7vx2gCy0j2sr_vsaKdmX9EoIqKw
   ### This is what a JWT looks like.
   ### Try to find the two dots separating the JWT sections!
   ```

   1. Header: This section defines the signing algorithm. I chose a **symmetric key algorithm** because itâ€™s simpler to implement than **asymmetric key algorithms.** ðŸ˜‚
   2. Payload: It contains **data fields**, such as user data and `JWT` expiration time. âœ… Every payload properties are called `claims`. 
   3. Signature: The signature is generated when the `JWT` is created. It is formed by encrypting the header and payload using the serverâ€™s `secret key`. Once created, the signature cannot be altered.

2. ### How is JWT used for authentication?

   <img src="/images/2025-03-13-quad_2/IMG_2646.jpg" alt="IMG_2646" style="zoom:25%" class="align-center" />

   1. The client signs in with a username and password and sends an `HTTP request` to the server for authentication.
   2. The server verifies whether the provided credentials are valid by checking them against the database.
   3. If valid, the server generates a `JWT`, and sends it to the client in an `HTTP response` as a`JSON` object.
   4. Once the client stores the `JWT`, it is used as a `Bearer Token` for authentication.
   5. For future requests, the client includes the `Bearer Token` in the `HTTP` headers until the `JWT` expires.
   6. When the client sends a request with the `Bearer Token`, the server verifies the `JWT`. If the token is valid and not expired, the server processes the request; otherwise, it rejects it.

## In which part of the application is the Bearer token validated?

In `Spring Boot`, when a client sends a request, it passes through several filters before reaching the controller. **Filters act as a security layer**, verifying whether the request is valid. 

Generally the request first goes through

1. `CORS` filter

2. `Spring Security` filter

3. Custom filters like `JwtAuthenticationFilter`

4. And finally reaches the `DispatcherSevlet` which maps HTTP request to appropriate controller.

1. ### CORS filter

   To understand `CORS`(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), we need to understand `SOP(Same-Origin Policy)`. `SOP`  is a fundamental security mechanism enforced by web browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different origin (protocol, domain, or port) than the one that served them. Origin refers to  the protocol, hostname and port of a web application. Here is a example of origin: 

   ```bash
   <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>
   ## e.g. http://localhost:3000
   ```

   By default, `SOP` prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests, protecting data from malicious websites. For example, a front-end application running on **http://localhost:3000** cannot directly access an API hosted at **http://localhost:8080** due to `SOP` restrictions.

   To enable cross-origin communication, the backend server must **explicitly allow the frontend domain** using `CORS` (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

   To allow a frontend (http://localhost:3000) to send requests to the backend, configuring `CORS` in the backend is required.

   ```java
   CorsConfiguration configuration = new CorsConfiguration();
           configuration.addAllowedOrigin("http://localhost:3000");
   ```

2. ### Spring Security filter

   Spring security applies security logics such as authentication (who you are), authorization (what can you access) and `CSRF` (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection. 

   In WebSecurityConfig.java, the security configuration file, thereâ€™s an interesting point to highlight.

   ```java
   httpSecurity.csrf(CsrfConfigurer::disable)
   ```

   I have explicitly disabled `CSRF`. Even for someone unfamiliar with `CSRF`, just reading the term might give the impression that disabling it is a bad idea. So why have I disabled it?

   `CSRF` (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack where a malicious website tricks an authenticated user into making unwanted requests to a web application while **they are logged in**. **Being logged in means that the user is authenticated and has an active session on the server, rather than using stateless token-based authentication like JWT.** In other words, it can be safely disabled when using `JWT` or `Bearer Tokens`.

3. ### JwtAuthenticationFilter

   JwtAuthenticationFilter is a custom Spring Security filter that extracts the JWT from the Authorization header, and validates it using JwtProvider. If the token is valid, it extracts the user details and stores them in SecurityContextHolder, making the user data accessible throughout the application.

   ```java
   SecurityContext securityContext = SecurityContextHolder.createEmptyContext();
   securityContext.setAuthentication(authenticationToken);
   
   SecurityContextHolder.setContext(securityContext);
   ```

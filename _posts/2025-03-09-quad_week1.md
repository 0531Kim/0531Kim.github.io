**UOA students face numerous barriers every semester when enrolling in new papers. They search for paper names on search engines and social media platforms but rarely find useful information about a paper. Moreover, the few posts or comments they do come across are often outdated and unhelpful.**

## Getting Started

Therefore, I decided to create a website where UOA students can write lecture reviews and give ratings. I was not able to find any front-end developer, but I guess this could be the perfect opportunity for me to become a full-stack developer.

This week, I have been working on the fundamentals of building a website: creating a rough draft using `Figma`, defining APIs in `Notion`, setting up the file structure with `Visual Studio Code`, and initializing database using `DCL`, `DML`, and `DDL`.

I decided to name a website `Quad`, name after a area at UOA where students gather and have meal. For the backend, I will be using `Spring Boot`, while the frontend will be built with `React` and `TypeScript`. `MySQL` will be the database at the moment, though that may change later.

The most important thing I focused on while designing the website was ensuring that the reviews are well-categorized by its department and study so that users can easily find the review they are looking for.

## Visualizing API structure ##

An `API document` is a structured document that organizes API endpoints by their addresses. It includes details such as **HTTP methods, API addresses, variable names, data types for requests and responses, and HTTP status codes.**

Creating an `API document` offers several benefits. In real-world development, an `API document` is crucial because it enables frontend developers to work independently without relying on backend data. By mocking `API responses`, the frontend can proceed with development without waiting for the backend to be completed.

However, as a full-stack developer handling both frontend and backend, the primary reason for creating an API document is to **synchronize types, variables, and error handling between the two sides.** Mismatches between the frontend and backend can lead to various issues, such as API request failures due to type errors and unexpected database behavior such as saving data in wrong data type. These reasons are also why I chose to use `TypeScript` instead of `JavaScript`, ensuring stricter type consistency.

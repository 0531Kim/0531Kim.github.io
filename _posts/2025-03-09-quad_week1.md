# Week 1 post 

I planned to create a website where students from UOA can write lecture reviews and give ratings. Since I needed a front-end developer, I tried to find one but ended up not finding anyone. No hesitation, though! This could be the perfect opportunity for me to become a full-stack developer.

This week, I have been working on the fundamentals of building a website: creating a rough draft using Figma, defining APIs in Notion, setting up the file structure, and working on database using `DCL`, `DML`, and `DDL`.

The website is called `Quad`, named after a place at UOA where students gather and have lunch. For the backend, I will use `Spring Boot`, while the frontend will be built with `React` and `TypeScript`. `MySQL` will be the database of choice, though that may change later.

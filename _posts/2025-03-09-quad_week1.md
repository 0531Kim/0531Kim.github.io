**UOA students face numerous barriers every semester when enrolling in new papers. They search for paper names on search engines and social media platforms but rarely find useful information about a paper. Moreover, the few posts or comments they do come across are often outdated and unhelpful.**

Therefore, I decided to create a website where UOA students can write lecture reviews and give ratings. I was not able to find any front-end developer, but I guess this could be the perfect opportunity for me to become a full-stack developer.

This week, I have been working on the fundamentals of building a website: creating a rough draft using Figma, defining APIs in Notion, setting up the file structure, and working on database using `DCL`, `DML`, and `DDL`.

I decided to name a website `Quad`, name after a area at UOA where students gather and have meal. For the backend, I will be using `Spring Boot`, while the frontend will be built with `React` and `TypeScript`. `MySQL` will be the database at the moment, though that may change later.

Each **circle, tilted triangle, and square** represents students from diverse backgrounds. The **heart symbolizes the love we share and receive in our campus.**

Nothing is perfectly aligned, but I guess my website will look something like this.

The most important thing I focused on while designing the website was ensuring that the reviews are well-categorized by its department and study so that users can easily find the review they are looking for.
